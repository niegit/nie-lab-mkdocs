This is used for linking infrastrucutre together such as switches, access points, etc. For example, when linking switches together, they typically need to be made aware of all VLANs so you'd need to configure a single Trunk port for each port that links two switches together. Another common example is when customers have Voice VLANs and PBX servers - you can leverage a trunk port so that the physical VoIP phone can be plugged into the main Voice VLAN, but can then tag the Lan VLAN on the port so that the phone can passthru the Lan connection to a PC. </p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Navigate to <code>VLAN Management &gt; Interface Settings</code>.</li> <li>Select the following interfaces and edit them to Trunk and Apply:<ul> <li>GE1: <code>NIE-LAB-T45-PAX8</code>.</li> <li>GE2: <code>AP01</code>.</li> <li>GE24: <code>SW02</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"labs/networking/lab1/#11-tagging-vlans","title":"11.
