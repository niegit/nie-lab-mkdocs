Any changes you make\u2014whether via CLI or the Web GUI\u2014are reflected here immediately. However, these changes are temporary and exist only in the switch\u2019s RAM. If the switch is restarted or powered off, the running configuration is erased.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcbe The startup configuration is the saved version of your settings stored in NVRAM (non-volatile memory).

This is used for linking infrastrucutre together such as switches, access points, etc. For example, when linking switches together, they typically need to be made aware of all possible VLANs so you'd need to configure a Trunk port on each switch.  Another common Trunk example is when customers have Voice VLANs and PBX servers - you can leverage a trunk port so that the physical VoIP phone or handset can be plugged into the main Voice VLAN, but can tag the Lan VLAN on the switchport as well so that the phone can passthru the main Lan connection to a PC for it to communicate.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Navigate to <code>VLAN Management &gt; Interface Settings</code>.</li> <li>Select the following interfaces and edit them to Trunk and Apply:<ul> <li>GE1: <code>NIE-LAB-T45-PAX8</code>.</li> <li>GE2: <code>AP01</code>.</li> <li>GE24: <code>SW02</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"labs/networking/lab1/#11-tagging-vlans","title":"11.
