This is used for linking infrastrucutre together such as switches, access points, etc. For example, when linking switches together, they typically need to be made aware of all possible VLANs so you'd need to configure a Trunk port on each switch. Another common example is when customers have Voice VLANs and PBX servers - you can leverage a trunk port so that the physical VoIP phone or handset can be plugged into the main Voice VLAN, but can tag the Lan VLAN on the switchport as well so that the phone can passthru the main Lan connection to a PC.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Navigate to <code>VLAN Management &gt; Interface Settings</code>.</li> <li>Select the following interfaces and edit them to Trunk and Apply:<ul> <li>GE1: <code>NIE-LAB-T45-PAX8</code>.</li> <li>GE2: <code>AP01</code>.</li> <li>GE24: <code>SW02</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"labs/networking/lab1/#11-tagging-vlans","title":"11.
