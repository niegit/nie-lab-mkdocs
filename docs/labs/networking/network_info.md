# Lab Resources

The information below will be used throughout the Networking labs and may be helpful to you. While each lab will strive to give you the information needed to complete it, this page will serve as a single resource where common information such as VLANs and IP addresses can be located for all networking labs. 

If you find any consistencies please let the proper resources know so that we can address them! We want to give you the best lab experience possible. ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ”¶ **VLAN Summary**

Get an at-a-glance overview of VLAN configurations, including IDs, subnets, and DHCP settings. These VLANs are designed to optimize security and network performance.

| **VLAN Name** | **VLAN ID** | **Subnet**         | **Default Gateway** | **DHCP Server**       | **DHCP Range**          |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
{% for vlan in extra.vlans.values() -%}
| {{ vlan.name }} | {{ vlan.id }} | {{ vlan.subnet }} | {{ vlan.gateway }} | {{ vlan.dhcp_server | default("Not Assigned") }} | {{ vlan.dhcp_range | default("Not Defined") }} |
{% endfor %}

### ðŸ–§ **Device Summary**

Easily locate lab devices and their key details, including IPs, VLANs, and descriptions, to understand their roles in the network.

| **Device Name** | **Type**          | **IP Address**     | **VLAN**   | **MAC Address**        | **Description**        |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
{% for device in extra.devices.values() -%}
| {{ device.name }} | {{ device.type }}  | {{ device.ip }}     | {{ device.vlan }} | {{ device.mac | default("Not Available") }} | {{ device.description | default("No description defined.") }} |
{% endfor %}

### ðŸ”„ **Network Design and Topology**

This section outlines the physical and logical setup of the lab network for better visualization and troubleshooting.

#### Firewall Uplink
- **Port 0 (WAN)**: Connects to the Lab Internet wall port  
- **Port 1 (LAN)**: Connects to SW01's GE1  

#### Cisco Switch Uplinks
- **GE1**: Connects to Firewall Port 1 (LAN)  
- **GE2**: Connects to Aruba Access Point
- **GE3**: Connects to DC01's NIC (Raspberry Pi)  
- **GE24**: Connects to SW02's GE1  

#### Aruba Switch Uplinks
- **GE1**: Connects to SW01's GE24
