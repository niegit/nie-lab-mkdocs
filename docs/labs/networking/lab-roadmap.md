# Lab Roadmap


## Lab 2: Advanced Switch Configuration
**Objective**: Restore switch from backup, solve network problems, and demonstrate VLAN tagging.

**Tasks**:

- Restore the switch configuration from a backup.
- Configure specific ports with different VLAN tags.
- Use endpoints to test network connectivity and demonstrate how VLAN tagging affects network traffic.
- Create a network share and test access across VLANs.

## Lab 3: Basic Firewall Configuration
**Objective**: Initial setup and basic configuration of the firewall.

**Tasks**:

- Add usernames and configure system settings.
- Add VLANs and configure firewall ports.
- Update IP settings and configure subscription services like geolocation and web blocker.
- Backup the firewall configuration.
- Reset the device for the next user.

## Lab 4: Advanced Firewall Configuration
**Objective**: Restore firewall and configure DHCP server.

**Tasks**:

- Restore the firewall configuration from a backup.
- Set up a DHCP server for the LAN.
- Connect the switch and an endpoint to the firewall and verify DHCP functionality.
- Setup DHCP reservations for your endpoint.
- Configure additional firewall rules and test network traffic.

## Lab 5: Aruba Instant On Management
**Objective**: Manage Aruba Instant On devices and integrate with the network.

**Tasks**:

- Add VLANs to the switch.
- Configure a WiFi network on the Aruba AP22.
- Connect an endpoint to the WiFi network and verify connectivity.
- Explore additional Aruba Instant On features like guest networks and bandwidth management.

## Lab 6: Subnetting and CIDR
**Objective**: Understand and apply subnetting and CIDR notation.

**Tasks**:

- Introduce the concepts of subnetting and CIDR.
- Calculate subnets and create a subnetting plan for a given network.
- Apply the subnetting plan to the network devices (switch, firewall, AP).
- Verify network connectivity and proper subnetting.

## Final Lab: Comprehensive Network Setup
**Objective**: Design and implement a complete network setup based on a given scenario.

**Tasks**:

- Create a network design with specified VLANs, subnets, and IP addresses.
- Configure switch ports with appropriate VLAN tags.
- Set up DHCP reservations for specific devices.
- Configure static IPs for network hardware.
- Verify the entire network setup through connectivity tests and troubleshooting.
