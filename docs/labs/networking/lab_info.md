## Lab Resources

### ðŸ”¶ **VLAN Summary**

Get an at-a-glance overview of VLAN configurations, including IDs, subnets, and DHCP settings. These VLANs are designed to optimize security and network performance.

| **VLAN Name** | **VLAN ID** | **Subnet**         | **Default Gateway** | **DHCP Server**       | **DHCP Range**          |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
{% for vlan in extra.vlans.values() -%}
| {{ vlan.name }} | {{ vlan.id }} | {{ vlan.subnet }} | {{ vlan.gateway }} | {{ vlan.dhcp_server | default("Not Assigned") }} | {{ vlan.dhcp_range | default("Not Defined") }} |
{% endfor %}

### ðŸ–§ **Device Summary**

Easily locate lab devices and their key details, including IPs, VLANs, and descriptions, to understand their roles in the network.

| **Device Name** | **Type**          | **IP Address**     | **VLAN**   | **MAC Address**        | **Description**        |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
{% for device in extra.devices.values() -%}
| {{ device.name }} | {{ device.type }}  | {{ device.ip }}     | {{ device.vlan }} | {{ device.mac | default("Not Available") }} | {{ device.description | default("No description defined.") }} |
{% endfor %}

### ðŸ”„ **Network Design and Topology**

This section outlines the physical and logical setup of the lab network for better visualization and troubleshooting.

#### Firewall Uplink
- **Port 0 (WAN)**: Connects to the Lab Internet wall port  
- **Port 1 (LAN)**: Connects to SW01's GE1  

#### Cisco Switch Uplinks
- **GE1**: Connects to Firewall Port 1 (LAN)  
- **GE2**: Connects to Aruba Access Point  
- **GE3**: Connects to DC01's NIC (Raspberry Pi)  
- **GE24**: Connects to SW02's GE1  

#### Aruba Switch Uplinks
- **GE1**: Connects to SW01's GE2

### ðŸ’¾ **Cisco Backup and Recovery Procedures**

#### **Backup Process**  
Configurations are regularly backed up to prevent data loss.  
- **Backup Location**: `{{ devices.cisco_switch.backup_location | default("USB/HTTP") }}`  

#### **Recovery Process**  
Restore configurations by uploading the saved file via the **File Operations** section after performing a factory reset.
