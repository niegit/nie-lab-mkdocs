## How to Use the Lab  

Each lab will provide you with the specific instructions to complete that lab, but below is **general** information about getting setup.

1. **Position the Rack**  
    - Move the rack to your desk or the **lab bench** in the back room. _You may need to unlock the caster wheels on the front of the rack._
    - Ensure itâ€™s stable and positioned conveniently, but out of the way of others.

    !!! tip "â›” Do Not Disturb â›”"  
        While the lab is not overly noisy, please be considerate of those around you. If you are sitting near someone, please ask if they mind if you power on the lab. Otherwise, feel free to move to a hoteling desk or the lab bench in the back!  

2. **Power It On**  
    - Plug the single **PDU power cable** into a wall outlet to provide power to the entire rack. _You may need to open the plastic cover and flip the red master switch on the PDU._

3. **Connect Your Laptop**  
    - Use the provided **blue Ethernet cables** to connect your laptop to the lab. Each specific lab will give you more information on how to get connected. If you need additional cables please let someone know.

    !!! danger "Connecting the Lab to Internet"  
        **Internet Access:** Most of our labs don't require Internet to function as we're mostly communicating on the Layer 2 network. If a specific lab calls for Internet, please be sure to connect the firewall WAN into the dedicated **Lab Network** port in the back room! **Please do NOT plug any part of the lab into the existing network.**  

4. **Save Your Work**  
    - Our labs will continuously build onto one another, so having a defined placed to store your configuration files will be important. We recommend saving them to your **OneDrive** or to a dedicated **USB drive**.  
    - By doing this, you'll be able to quickly restore your previous configurations and pick up exactly where you left off last time!

5. **Clean Up**  
    - Remove the **blue Ethernet cables** connecting your laptop or other endpoints.  
    - Leave the infrastructure connected _(e.g., switches, firewall, AP)_.  
    - Power off devices and neatly organize cables. Leave the rack ready for the next person!  

6. **Report Issues**
